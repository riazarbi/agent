- Use LiteLLM's built-in provider support

#### Session Storage
- Simple JSON files in ~/.agent/sessions/
- Session ID format: YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS
- No metadata beyond conversation history

#### Tool Implementation  
- Single bash tool only
- Use subprocess.run() with shell=True
- Basic timeout handling (30 seconds default)
- Optional confirmation prompts

#### Configuration
- YAML file at ~/.agent/config.yaml
- Environment variables: API_KEY, MODEL, BASE_URL
- Minimal configuration options only

# Implement Comprehensive Go Testing

*This user story addresses the critical need to implement a comprehensive test suite for the existing mature Go project. The main objective is to establish robust testing that validates the intended operation of the entire codebase, following the established testing guidelines and best practices for agent-friendly codebases, ensuring stability and preventing regressions.*

## Past Attempts

If this user story has been attempted before, the changes made will appear in the git diff. Our policy is to only make a single commit per user story, so you can always review the git diff to review progress across attempts. 

## Requirements

*Specific, measurable acceptance criteria. These define when the story is complete.*


- The executor MUST create a `PROGRESS.md` file in the root of the project to outline the detailed, fine-grained plan for implementing tests IF IT DOES NOT EXIST. 
- If `PROGRESS.md` exists, resume the plan.
This file MUST be updated frequently to reflect progress and enable seamless continuation if the task is interrupted or transferred.
- The executor MUST make use of todoread and todowrite to keep track of subtasks.
- Comprehensive unit tests MUST be implemented for the following high-priority files, ensuring all critical functions and logic are covered:
    - `cmd/agent/main.go`
    - `internal/agent/agent.go`
    - `internal/config/config.go`
    - `internal/errors/errors.go`
- Unit tests MUST be written in `_test.go` files alongside their respective source files.
- Tests MUST adhere to the "No API Mocking" principle, testing against real APIs with proper skip logic where applicable.
- Test coverage for the high-priority files (main.go, agent.go, config.go, errors.go) SHOULD aim for a minimum of 80% line coverage, with a target of 90%.
- Integration tests SHOULD be considered and implemented for interactions between these high-priority components where appropriate.
- All newly implemented tests MUST pass successfully.
- The project's existing Go Best Practices for Agent-Friendly Codebases and Testing Guide for Code Editing Agent MUST be consulted and followed throughout the testing implementation.

## Rules

*Important constraints or business rules that must be followed.*

- The `PROGRESSS.md` file is a critical deliverable and MUST be maintained meticulously.
- `internal/tools/` is a lower priority and should only be addressed after the high-priority files have comprehensive testing.
- No mocks are allowed for API testing; real API calls with skip logic are mandatory.
- Tests must be maintainable and follow the structure outlined in the Testing Guide.

## Domain

*Core domain model in pseudo-code if applicable.*

```
// Key entities and relationships that need to be tested for behavior and interaction.
// Examples include agent execution flow, configuration loading, and error handling mechanisms.
// Focus on the high-priority modules:
// - main: Application entry point and initialization
// - agent: Core agent logic, state management, and tool interaction
// - config: Configuration loading, parsing, and validation
// - errors: Custom error types and handling patterns
```

## Extra Considerations

*Edge cases, non-functional requirements, or gotchas.*

- Consider edge cases for configuration parsing and validation.
- Ensure error handling logic is robust and tested for various failure scenarios.
- The executor should leverage `go test -coverprofile` to track and report coverage.
- Tests should be designed to be fast and provide quick feedback.

## Testing Considerations

*What types of tests are needed and what scenarios to cover.*

- **Unit Tests:** Focus on individual functions and methods within `main.go`, `agent.go`, `config.go`, and `errors.go`.
    - Cover successful execution paths.
    - Cover error conditions and edge cases (e.g., malformed config, unexpected agent states).
    - Utilize table-driven tests for multiple scenarios.
- **Integration Tests:** Test interactions between the high-priority modules (e.g., how `agent` uses `config`, how `main` initializes `agent`).
- **API Tests:** For any external API interactions, ensure real API calls are used with appropriate skip logic and environment variable checks as per the Testing Guide.
- **Test Data Management:** Create small, focused test data and fixtures where necessary.

## Implementation Notes

*Architectural patterns, coding standards, or technology preferences.*

- The executor should start by thoroughly analyzing the existing code in the high-priority files to understand its functionality and identify testable units.
- Refer heavily to the "Testing Guide for Code Editing Agent" for structure, build tags, helper functions, and test writing standards.
- Adhere to the "Go Best Practices for Agent-Friendly Codebases" for code organization, naming conventions, and error handling patterns, as these practices facilitate testability.
- Prioritize testing critical paths and known risky areas first.
- The executor should use `t.Cleanup()` for proper resource management in tests.

## Specification by Example

*Concrete examples: API samples, user flows, or interaction scenarios.*

- **Example 1: `config.go` Unit Test (Success)**
    - Given a valid configuration file, when `LoadConfig` is called, then the configuration struct is populated correctly without error.
- **Example 2: `config.go` Unit Test (Error)**
    - Given a malformed configuration file, when `LoadConfig` is called, then a specific error (e.g., `ErrInvalidConfig`) is returned.
- **Example 3: `agent.go` Unit Test (Behavior)**
    - Given an agent in a specific state, when a tool is invoked with valid parameters, then the agent's internal state is updated as expected.
- **Example 4: `main.go` Integration Test (Initialization)**
    - Given a valid environment, when the `main` function is executed (or its core initialization logic), then the agent and its dependencies are initialized correctly.

## Verification

*Actionable checklist to verify story completion.*

- [ ] A `PROGRESSS.md` file exists in the project root and has been regularly updated.
- [ ] Unit tests are implemented for `cmd/agent/main.go`, `internal/agent/agent.go`, `internal/config/config.go`, and `internal/errors/errors.go`.
- [ ] All new tests pass successfully.
- [ ] Test coverage for the specified high-priority files meets or exceeds the 80% minimum target.
- [ ] API tests (if any are identified) use real APIs with proper skip logic.
- [ ] The test suite can be run using `go test ./...` (or with appropriate build tags).
- [ ] The executor has provided a summary of the work done and the current test coverage.

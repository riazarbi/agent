# Fix Failing Tests

*The 'task test' command is currently failing, preventing proper validation of the codebase. The objective is to update the test suite so that all tests pass when 'task test' is executed, without altering the existing application code or the Taskfile.*

## Past Attempts


## Requirements

- task test passes

## Rules

- The Taskfile may not be altered.
- The code may not be altered; however, if the executor determines that code alterations are necessary, they should report this to the user for further review.

## Domain

```
// No specific domain model changes are expected for this task.
```

## Extra Considerations

- Focus solely on test fixes; avoid introducing new features or modifying existing application logic.

## Testing Considerations

- The primary test is the execution of 'task test' itself. All individual tests within the suite must pass.

## Implementation Notes

- Review existing test files to identify discrepancies between expected behavior (as defined by current code functionality) and actual test assertions.
- Adjust test assertions, mock data, or test setup/teardown logic as needed to align with current code behavior.

## Specification by Example

- Given 'task test' is executed
- When the tests run
- Then all tests should pass successfully, and the 'task test' command should exit with a success status.

## Verification

- [ ] Execute 'task test' from the command line.
- [ ] Confirm that all tests report as passed.
- [ ] Verify that no changes were made to the application code or the Taskfile.

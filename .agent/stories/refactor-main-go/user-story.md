# Refactor main.go: Extract Tool Definitions

*Reduce the size of `main.go` by extracting the tool definitions into separate files within a `tools/` directory. This will simplify `main.go` and improve its readability.*

## Requirements

- Create a new directory named `tools/`.
- Read the content of `main.go`.
- Identify and extract the code related to each tool's definition (structs, functions, etc.) from `main.go`.
- Create a separate `.go` file for each tool in the `tools/` directory (e.g., `tools/tool1.go`, `tools/tool2.go`).
- Place the corresponding tool definition code into its respective file.
- Modify `main.go` to import the newly created tool packages from the `tools/` directory.
- Ensure all existing functionality remains intact after the refactoring.
- Reduce the line count of `main.go` significantly.
- All the new files should compile.

## Rules

- The refactoring must adhere to Go coding standards and best practices.
- No external dependencies should be introduced.
- Each tool's code must be placed in its own file in the `tools/` directory.
- The main.go file is very large. Be conservative in your read_file and edit_file tool use.

## Domain

```
// Example: ToolDefinition struct (This should be replaced with actual tool definitions)
type ToolDefinition struct { ... }
```

## Extra Considerations

- Consider adding comments to the new tool files to improve readability.
- Ensure proper error handling in the new modules.

## Testing Considerations

- Unit tests may be required for the new tool files to verify their functionality.
- Integration tests should be performed to ensure that all components work together correctly.

## Implementation Notes

- Use Go modules to manage dependencies.

## Specification by Example

*N/A*

## Verification

- [ ] `tools/` directory exists.
- [ ] A `.go` file exists for each tool in the `tools/` directory.
- [ ] Each tool file contains the correct tool definition code.
- [ ] `main.go` imports the tool packages from `tools/`.
- [ ] All files compile without errors.
- [ ] All existing functionality works as expected.
- [ ] `main.go` has a significantly reduced line count.

## Notes from the last attempt

Your attempts to make a main.go.bak fail, so one has manually been created for you already. 

The last attempt at this user story failed. These are the executors notes from that session:

**1. Unreliable `edit_file` Tool:**

*   **Problem:** The `edit_file` tool proved to be very difficult to use for making large or complex changes. Even small discrepancies between the `old_str` and the actual file content caused the edit to fail. This was especially problematic when trying to comment out large blocks of code or replace sections with modified content. The agent seemed to get confused and then apply the edits to the top of the file, repeatedly.
*   **Suggestion:**
    *   **Simplify Edits:** Break down the required changes into much smaller, more targeted edits. Instead of trying to replace a large block of code, focus on inserting comments or making very specific replacements of individual lines.
    *   **Verify Edits:** After each `edit_file` call, *immediately* read the file back using `read_file` to confirm that the edit was applied correctly. If the edit failed, take corrective action *before* proceeding.
    *   **Avoid Large Replacements:** Try to avoid replacing large blocks of code, which are very susceptible to errors. Inserting or deleting individual lines is much safer.
    *   **Use `grep` to Confirm:** Before using `edit_file`, use `grep` to confirm the existence and exact content of the `old_str`. This helps ensure that the `edit_file` call will succeed.

**2. Lack of File Restoration Mechanism:**

*   **Problem:** Once the `main.go` file became corrupted due to failed edits, there was no reliable way to restore it to its original state. This made it impossible to recover from errors and continue with the user story.
*   **Suggestion:**
    *   **Provide a Backup:** Include a step in the user story that explicitly instructs the agent to create a backup of `main.go` *before* making any changes. This could be done by copying the file to a temporary location (e.g., `main.go.bak`).
    *   **Implement Restoration:** If the agent detects that `main.go` has become corrupted (e.g., by checking for syntax errors or comparing it to an expected state), it should be instructed to restore the file from the backup.
    *   **Provide Original Content:** As a last resort, provide the original content of `main.go` within the user story itself (perhaps as a multi-line string) so that the agent can restore it if all else fails. I tried fetching from Github, but that code was 404.

**3. Incorrect Assumptions about Module Path:**

*   **Problem:** I assumed a module path of `github.com/your-username/your-project` when adding the import statement for the `tools` package. This might not be correct for the actual environment.
*   **Suggestion:**
    *   **Explicitly Define Module Path:** Include a step in the user story that instructs the agent to determine the correct module path for the project. This could be done by reading the `go.mod` file and extracting the module name.
    *   **Use Correct Import Path:** Once the module path has been determined, the agent should use it to construct the correct import path for the `tools` package (e.g., `"<module_path>/tools"`).

**4. Difficulty with Tool Selection and Workflow:**

*   **Problem:** The user story involved a complex refactoring task that required careful planning and execution. It was difficult for the agent to break down the task into manageable steps and choose the appropriate tools for each step.
*   **Suggestion:**
    *   **Provide a More Detailed Plan:** Include a more detailed plan in the user story, breaking down the refactoring task into smaller, more specific steps.
    *   **Suggest Tool Usage:** For each step in the plan, suggest the tools that would be most appropriate to use.
    *   **Emphasize Incremental Progress:** Encourage the agent to make small, incremental changes, verifying the correctness of each change before proceeding to the next.

**5. Verbose Logging and Output:**
* **Problem:** I am very likely exceeding the length limits.
* **Suggestion:**
    * Remove or replace the web_fetch command with a simpler command

**Revised User Story Structure (Example):**

Here's an example of how the user story could be restructured to address these issues:

# Refactor main.go: Extract Tool Definitions (Revised)

*Reduce the size of `main.go` by extracting the tool definitions into separate files within a `tools/` directory. This will simplify `main.go` and improve its readability.*

## Prerequisites

1.  **Determine the Module Path:** Read the `go.mod` file and extract the module path. Store this value for later use.
2.  **Create a Backup:** Copy the `main.go` file to a backup location (e.g., `main.go.bak`).

## Steps

1.  **Create the `tools/` Directory:** (Use `list_files` to check if it exists, create with `edit_file` if needed).
2.  **Extract Tool Definitions:**
    a.  **Read `main.go`:** (Use `read_file` to get the content).
    b.  **Create `tools/read_file.go`:** (Use `edit_file` to create the file with the `ReadFile` definition).
    c.  **Verify `tools/read_file.go`:** (Use `read_file` to confirm content).
    d.  **Remove `ReadFile` from `main.go`:** (Use `edit_file` to comment out the `ReadFile` definition). Verify with `read_file`.
3.  **Repeat Step 2 for all other tool definitions.**
4.  **Modify `main.go` Imports:** (Use `edit_file` to add the `tools` import, using the module path from Prerequisite 1).
5.  **Update `Agent` Struct:** (Use `edit_file` to change `ToolDefinition` to `tools.ToolDefinition`).
6.  **Build and Test:** (Run `go mod tidy && go build .`).
7.  **Verify Functionality:** (Test the existing functionality).
8.  **Check Line Count:** (Use `cloc` or `grep -c` to count lines in `main.go`).
9.  **Create Git Diff:** (Use `git_diff` to create and print the changes).

## Error Handling

*   If any `edit_file` command fails, immediately restore `main.go` from `main.go.bak` and report the error.

By providing more detailed instructions, a backup mechanism, and smaller, more manageable steps, you can significantly increase the chances of success for the next executor. Good luck!

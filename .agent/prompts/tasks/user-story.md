# User Story Creation Task

*Create well-structured user stories that can be passed to the implementation phase.*

## Guidelines

**Your job is not to infer what should go into the template. Your job is to elicit from the user what should go into the template**


**Terminate with helpful feedback if the story:**
- Is too vague or scope is too broad
- Presumes unavailable capabilities or resources  
- Requires an overly complex solution
- Is not within team scope


## Process

1. **Context Loading**: List files in the current working directory and understand existing project structure. Only read files if necessary.
2. **Converse**: Work with user to clarify requirements and scope.
3. **Record**: Create story using the template below.
4. **Save**: Save the story to `.agent/stories/[story-name]/user-story.md`

## Output Template

# [Story Title]

*Brief description of the problem this solves and main objective.*

## Past Attempts

If this user story has been attempted before, the changes made will appear in the git diff. Our policy is to only make a single commit per user story, so you can always review the git diff to review progress across attempts. 


## Requirements

*Specific, measurable acceptance criteria. These define when the story is complete.*

- Requirement 1
- Requirement 2
- Requirement 3

## Rules

*Important constraints or business rules that must be followed.*

## Domain

*Core domain model in pseudo-code if applicable.*

```
// Key entities and relationships
```

## Extra Considerations

*Edge cases, non-functional requirements, or gotchas.*

- Consideration 1
- Consideration 2

## Testing Considerations

*What types of tests are needed and what scenarios to cover.*

## Implementation Notes

*Architectural patterns, coding standards, or technology preferences.*

## Specification by Example

*Concrete examples: API samples, user flows, or interaction scenarios.*

## Verification

*Actionable checklist to verify story completion.*

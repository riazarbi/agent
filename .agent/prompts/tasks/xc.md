# Your Task

You are working on a new feature for this codebase. THis work is long running, and spans over several sessions. 

- Read all the files in the folder xc_migration. This folder is your project tracking folder. Determine the next task to do, and then do it. 
- When you build, changes will not be available in _your_ environment. YOu are running a static binary of the agent and your binary won't change once you rebuild. 
- You can, however, use `task build` to build a fresh binary, and pass a prompt to the rebuilt binary with `task dev` to test functionality. 
- Just bear in mind you need to set API keys and urls with the following environment variables:

AGENT_API_KEY=$GEMINI_API_KEY AGENT_BASE_URL=https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/

- FREQUENTLY UPDATE YOUR PROJECT NOTES; YOUR SESSION WILL BE TEMRINATED WITHOUT WARNING AFTER A SET PERIOD OF TIME
- PROCEED NONINTERACTIVELY. USE TODOREAD AND TODOWRITE TO KEEP YOURSELF ON TRACK IN THE SESSION
- PROVIDE A CLEAR RUNNING COMMENTARY AS YOU PROGRESS SO THAT WE CAN FOLLOW YOUR ACTIONS IN THE CHAT.
- BEWARE GETTING STUCK IN LOOPS. IF YOU FAIL TO FIX A PROBLEM QUICKLY, DON'T THRASH FOR ANSWERS. STOP AND TELL THE USER WHAT YOU ARE STUCK ON AND ASK FOR HELP
